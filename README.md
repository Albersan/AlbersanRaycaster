#AlbersanRaycaster
This is a small project I have made for my computer degree thesis. 
It is a Raycasting engine imitating the style of Wolfenstein 3D. 
It also has the architecture of a Game Engine, with the posibility of spawn Actors into the map.

How to use it:

You need to have:
- Windows 
- CMake
- Visual Studio prepared with C++.

1) Execute the Setup.bat and it will create the Project files and download the libraries.
2) Execute CompileExecuteDebug.bat, and it will compile and open the game :)
